# Heart_Diseases_app
❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses medical data to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using Machine Learning algorithms. It helps in early detection by analyzing health parameters and providing accurate predictions.

🚀 Features

→ Utilizes Random Forest Classifier for prediction

→ Data preprocessing with scaling using StandardScaler

→ Achieved accuracy of approximately 85%

→ Accepts real-time input from users for instant predictions
